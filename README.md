# Supply-Chain-Management

Using this blockchain based supply chain management system all the stakeholders can view the journey of an item from the manufacturer to its final destination.

Blockchain provides all parties within a respective supply chain with access to the same information, potentially reducing communication or transfer data errors. Less time can be spent validating data and more can be spent on delivering goods and servicesâ€”either improving quality, reducing cost, or both.
